Bike Sharing Prediction with NeuralNetwork
In this project, I built a neural network from scratch to predict daily bike rental ridership. This project was built only using numpy. 

Specifications:
The project meets the specifications, which are:

All the code in the notebook runs in Python 3 without failing, and all unit tests pass.
The sigmoid activation function is implemented correctly
The forward pass is correctly implemented for the network's training.
The run method correctly produces the desired regression output for the neural network.
The network correctly implements the backward pass for each batch, correctly updating the weight change.
Updates to both the input-to-hidden and hidden-to-output weights are implemented correctly.
The number of epochs is chosen such the network is trained well enough to accurately make predictions but is not overfitting to the training data.
The number of hidden units is chosen such that the network is able to accurately predict the number of bike riders, is able to generalize, and is not overfitting.
The learning rate is chosen such that the network successfully converges, but is still time efficient.
The number of output nodes is properly selected to solve the desired problem.
The training loss is below 0.09 and the validation loss is below 0.18.
